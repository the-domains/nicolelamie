            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Christine Nation | Eastern Carolina Headshot photographer</h1><p>The lovely and stunning Christine Nation came to me for some headshots in my New Bern studio on her way out of town.  She was flying to LA for fashion week to support her magazine LA Style.  She wanted a new, more professional looking headshot to go in the next issue of the magazine that she edits, since it's already growing by leaps and bounds and this is just the 2nd issue.  She has since made the big move from NC to Cali just to help it grow even more!  Its time for big and bold moves, and Christine is ready to take on the world!</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ca0995efdb3bc1c05135316f7f8e6040581d0f46.jpg"></article>]]></description>
